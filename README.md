# E-Commerce Store using React Native
### Zoe Wortzman and Nina Paripovic

## What you built? 

We built a web page for e-commerce using React Native. We were granted an extension due to sickness.

Include some screenshots.

## Who Did What?

We took turns with building certain components. Nina set up the initial structure and created the Products page. Zoe worked on the navigation bar, shopping cart, and linking it to the API.

## What you learned

Once we learnt the general pattern of how functional components work, it was fairly easy to add additional components. However, the initial syntax was a bit difficult to understand. We also had issues with the API and found online documentation and troubleshooting difficult to follow.

## What didn't work
We still cannot get images to show up on the website and have no idea why.
